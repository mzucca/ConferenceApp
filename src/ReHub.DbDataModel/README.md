# ReHub Data model
I this document we'll explore the details of the data access layer for the Rehub project.
This project uses entity framework core to access database data. We adopted the multiple project approach to support different database.
At the moment only <b>PostgreSQL</b> is supported.
## Inheritance
To map inheritance we adopted the TPT (Table per Type) approach. 



# TODO
1. <b>Remove TEMP folder</b>
