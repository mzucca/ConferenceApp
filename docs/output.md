## Module Description: Creating Server Routes - Friends Invitations

The module is responsible for creating server routes for handling friend invitations. It involves the creation of routes, controllers, and validation schemas to facilitate the process of sending and handling friend invitations.

### Server Trace File
The server trace file is used to register the routes for logging, registration, and friend invitations. It involves creating a new file for friend invitation routes and defining the necessary logic for handling friend invitations.

### Friend Invitation Routes
The module creates a new file for friend invitation routes in the "Roots" folder. It defines the routes and uses Express, Router Joy, and validation middleware to handle the friend invitation process. The module also defines a validation schema for the post invitation, ensuring that the email address provided is valid.

Significant piece of code:
```javascript
// Creating friend invitation routes
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const validator = require('express-joi-validation').createValidator({ passError: true });
const { postInvitationSchema } = require('./validationSchemas');

// Define validation rules for email address
const postInvitationValidation = validator.body(postInvitationSchema);

// Define post request for friend invitation
router.post('/invite', verifyToken, postInvitationValidation, friendInvitationController.postInvite);

module.exports = router;
```

### Friend Invitation Controllers
The module creates a new file for friend invitation controllers, which includes the logic for handling friend invitations. It defines the post invite controller to handle the process of sending friend invitations and saving the information in the database.

Significant piece of code:
```javascript
// Post invite controller
exports.postInvite = (req, res) => {
  const { targetEmail } = req.body;
  // Logic to save invitation in the database
  // Send response to the user
  res.send('Friend invitation sent successfully');
};
```

### Error Handling
The module also includes error handling to ensure that the process of sending friend invitations is smooth and any errors are appropriately handled.

### Conclusion
The module provides the necessary infrastructure for handling friend invitations, including routes, controllers, validation, and error handling. It ensures that the process of sending and handling friend invitations is efficient and reliable.
